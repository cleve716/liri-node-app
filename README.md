<span style="background-color: #E6E6FA">node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here></span>

This will search the Bands in Town Artist Events API for an artist and render the following information about each event to the terminal:

- Artist/band name
- Name of the venue
- Venue location
- Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "Day, date, and time")
